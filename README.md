# Advent of code in Ruby

Here lie the puzzle solutions written in Ruby, using Object-Oriented Programming for exercise and fun, grouped by year. Maybe one day I'll finish all the years.

## Ground rules:
- No AI, obviously. I swear I typed every single character with my bare hands and did not ask Genie for any solutions.
- Heavy use of Object-Oriented Programming. Why? Because it’s cool and the more you practice, the better you become, and the less you end up writing dummy procedural code pretending to be objects.
- No gems, just the standard library.
- Code clarity and expressiveness are taken very seriously, aiming for code that is almost fluent English and easy to read.
